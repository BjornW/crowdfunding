== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with any theme? =

Not at this time. However, it is very easy to integrate with a theme. There are a few custom templates that need to be set up. Simply create a single-campaign.php, archive-campaigns.php, and single-campaign-backers.php and you are ready to go. These files act like a standard archive or single template in WordPress.
